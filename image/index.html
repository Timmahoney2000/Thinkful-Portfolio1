    <h2>Timoty J. Mahoney</h2>

    <p>I am an ex chef who has spent approximately 15 years in fine dining working in some of the top kitchens in New Jersey.
        After the birth of my son I knew I wanted to spend more time with him as opposed to the typical 16 hour workdays in 
        kitchens. I have always had a personal interested in computer science, building my own systems & manipulating
        software from the age of 16. I recently graduated college with an AAS in Computer Science and a major in programming.
        I have worked extensively with html5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I also have experience with Python, Java and React.
        Currently I am enrolled in the Engineering Immersion course with Thinkful & expect to graduate by January 2021.</p>

        <p>I spend most of my free time at the beach with my son and wife. When the weather gets cold, we hit the ski slopes
            and unwind by playing some boardgames or the Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>Once I graduate I feel I would truly enjoy working with frontend technologies in the field. 
                The ones that have my attention the most are:</p>

                <ul class="interests">
                    <li>React</li>
                    <li>Meteor</li>
                    <li>Flutter</li>
                </ul>
